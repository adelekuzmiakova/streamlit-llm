### ðŸš€ Starting setup:

In your terminal, navigate to the project repository. Then let's create an isolated Python environment which will contain dependencies **unique** to this project:
```python
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

Install dependencies:

```python
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
